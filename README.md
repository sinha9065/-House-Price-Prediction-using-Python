# -House-Price-Prediction-using-Python
This project was developed as part of my internship at *Novanectar Services Pvt. Ltd.* It focuses on predicting house prices using various regression techniques.

## 📦 Dataset

Loaded from a CSV file containing housing data:
- Area
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Location
- Price (target)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values
- Dropped rows with many nulls
- Filled remaining nulls with median
- Basic feature engineering

---

📈 Visualizations
Outlier box plots
Residual distribution histogram
Residuals vs Actual Prices scatter plot
Comparison graphs between outliers and errors

## ⚙ Models Applied

- LinearRegression  
- DecisionTreeRegressor  
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)


## 🧮 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score


🔧 Technologies & Tools
Programming Language: Python
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy for data handling
matplotlib, seaborn for visualization
sklearn for modeling and evaluation

🔍 Results Summary
Best Model: Linear Regression (based on RMSE and simplicity)
Use Case: Can assist real estate companies and buyers in estimating home prices based on property features
